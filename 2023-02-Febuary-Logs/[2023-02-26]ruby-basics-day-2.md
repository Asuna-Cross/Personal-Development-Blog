Today I'm continuing on with Ruby basics from TOP, I'm hoping to make it through at least two section today, if I'm able to do more then I will be happy.

For a change, I am up and active earlier on in the day compared to yesterday.

Today's first lesson is Input and Output. One of the lines in it did hit a bit of a slap, "code golf" describes the exsct mindset that I used to have back in my university days which caused me to fail C++ programming. At least I have grown since then and know that it's not worth it to fall into that pit again.

Went for a short walk between sessions. Onto conditional logic now.

So, an empty string won't automatically throw back a false, it depends on the rest of the logic behind it... This is going to be interesting.

if statements being written on the same line if it's all the one thing. I think I might avoid doing that at first and write it all out properly until I'm more comfortable so I don't end up in the state I used to be in during my university days.
