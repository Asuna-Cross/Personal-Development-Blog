For the past few days I have been working on the etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project.

There's a lot of notes about my learning during it, one being that I don't think that I was taught the specific concepts that was needed to complete the project. In the end, I was struggling to put it together with no idea of what to look for.

I found a tutorial over the project and found that I wasn't the only person who was having difficulties being able to complete the project. I followed along and are going to research more into all the different topics that they mentioned for being able to complete it.

I did use various methods to get the box to work to start off with, including inner-html, which after further searching, was dropped as I found out about the security concerns regarding inner-html. Even though I'm not that far into the project, I would like to develop good habits for security and safety as I go so that I won't need to relearn them later on.
