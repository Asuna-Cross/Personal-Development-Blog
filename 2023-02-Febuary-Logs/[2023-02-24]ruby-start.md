Went on to finish the foundations course for the Odin Project, will go back and complete the calculator from it at a future time when I'm in a better headspace to do so (See [2023-02-20] log for more information)

Hmm... Reading through the introduction to Ruby, I have experience in Python already, having gotten quite far through Automating the Boring Stuff, so hopefully this will come more naturally to me than Javascript.

Looking at the sections that this will be teaching, thankfully a lot of it I do know from Python, but also from doing Visual Basic many, many, years ago (Don't even question how many years), also from doing some Flash as well... That was a wild time.

This all seems to be a lot more like what I want to do and a lot more in my comfort zone compared to what I have been doing up until now.
