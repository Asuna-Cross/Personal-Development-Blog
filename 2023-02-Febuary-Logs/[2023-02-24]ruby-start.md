Went on to finish the foundations course for the Odin Project, will go back and complete the calculator from it at a future time when I'm in a better headspace to do so (See [2023-02-20] log for more information)

Hmm... Reading through the introduction to Ruby, I have experience in Python already, having gotten quite far through Automating the Boring Stuff, so hopefully this will come more naturally to me than Javascript.

Looking at the sections that this will be teaching, thankfully a lot of it I do know from Python, but also from doing Visual Basic many, many, years ago (Don't even question how many years), also from doing some Flash as well... That was a wild time.

This all seems to be a lot more like what I want to do and a lot more in my comfort zone compared to what I have been doing up until now.

Preferred case for Ruby is snake_case, constants are denoted with all uppercase letters, CamelCase is used for class names.

A question to think on later... Is it more effective to have a base box as a .box file if it has all the required things, or use a more generic box and work it up with ansible to make it specific for each use?

The Odin Project is requiring *a lot* of trust from it's learners when it comes to installing Ruby from what I've seen, they are having me copy and paste commands directly into my terminal...

Ruby is fully installed, as I use VSCode for my env I have installed the suggested packages for here too.

Going offline for now, may be back on before bed, otherwise will continue tomorrow. It's after 11pm at the time of finishing up the writing for this.

So overall today, have been able to complete the introduction to Ruby section and moving onto Basic Ruby next time.
