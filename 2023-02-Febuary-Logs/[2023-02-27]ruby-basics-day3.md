Back on today with Ruby, hoping to achieve two more lessons as a staring point today.

First lesson today is on hashes.

> Ruby hashes are more advanced collections of data and are similar to objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python if youâ€™re familiar with those.

I am familiar with dictionaries in Python yes. This seems like it's going to be very useful and I'm rather glad that I've managed to get so far through Python that this isn't completely new to me.

I will give compliments to TOP for the analogy that they've used to describe Arrays vs Hashes, that was a good one and explained it well.

.fetch will overcome having a nil returned if the key is not present in the hash.

Symbols are a better way of syntax than other methods for storing hashes as they are cleaner.

Hashes section is completed, I need to be careful that I've got the correct syntax when working with hashes as that is where my mistakes were coming in during the assignment.

Onto the lesson about methods now.
