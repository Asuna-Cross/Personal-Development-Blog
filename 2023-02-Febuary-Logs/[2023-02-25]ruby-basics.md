Working on Ruby Basics section of TOP today.

Hoping that a lot of this will be familiur to me given my knowledge in Python, but I will see.

Made it through the Basic Data Types, next up tomorrow is to do the coding part of the assignment.

Not got as much energy as yesterday to power on through things.

# Notes

A reminder - Integers return integers, floats return floats.

to_f => To Float
to_i => To Integer
to_s => To String

Can concat using following - +, <<, .concat('')
