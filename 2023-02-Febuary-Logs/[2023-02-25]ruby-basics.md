Working on Ruby Basics section of TOP today.

Hoping that a lot of this will be familiur to me given my knowledge in Python, but I will see.

Made it through the Basic Data Types, next up tomorrow is to do the coding part of the assignment.

Not got as much energy as yesterday to power on through things.

Upstairs neighbour is drunk, so I'm back...

Cloned into the Ruby exercises repo and got RSpec installed, time to bash through these.

Also, Death Cab for Cutie's song Black Sun is on repeat >.<

Completed Basic Data types, it really is super similar to Python, with just lots more built in things so far.

Finished off the day by completing the next section of Ruby Basics, which was on variables.

# Notes

A reminder - Integers return integers, floats return floats.

to_f => To Float
to_i => To Integer
to_s => To String

Can concat using following - +, <<, .concat('')
