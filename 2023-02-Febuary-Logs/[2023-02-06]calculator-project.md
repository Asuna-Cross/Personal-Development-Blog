# Work so far today
Made the repo and cloned into it on my main machine.
Got the boilerplate for the HTML inserted and linked to both stylesheets, a reset one and my working one.


Moved onto my notepad to sktech everything out.

Using the etch-a-sketch for reference, I've put all the buttons into the HTML file, all that awaits now is to do the code to link them up and get the calculator working.

Been working on doing smaller commits so that it can be easier to roll back if anything needs done, and making my commit messages better.

# To-do for today
- Start thinking about code to do for making buttons work
