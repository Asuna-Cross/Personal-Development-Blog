# Work so far today
Made the repo and cloned into it on my main machine.
Got the boilerplate for the HTML inserted and linked to both stylesheets, a reset one and my working one.


Moved onto my notepad to sktech everything out.


# To-do for today
- Make layout with buttons
- Start thinking about code to do for making buttons work
