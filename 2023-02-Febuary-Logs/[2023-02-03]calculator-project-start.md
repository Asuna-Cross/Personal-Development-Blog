Calculator Project

> Notes

Up next is the calculator project for Odin Project, going to break down what I need to do for it and start working on it for the next few days.

I think for the calculator itself it could be buttons for simplicity. All of them together in a flexbox container to keep them nice and contained.

The functions for operators should be simple enough to put together. However inputting the numbers will be slightly more difficult to code as I will need to figure out some way of inputting multiple digits.

Will think more on this during tomorrow's coding session.
