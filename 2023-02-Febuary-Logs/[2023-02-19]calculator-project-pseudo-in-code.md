More work done on the calculator project.

The main questions being asked when I started it today was how was I going to be able to switch between variables and how to get the operators working.

I managed to get some semblance of pseudocode for this completed and into the project as a bare bones for the coding section. From here I need to refine it slightly and break down the code sections from being repeated everywhere to more broken down into managable sections for me to use.

Thinking of turning shared functions into their own seperate functions and calling them in the main code, as this will cut down on code needed.
