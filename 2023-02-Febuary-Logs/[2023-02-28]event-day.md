Final day of the month, and today has been an interesting day.

Not done much on coding, so hoping to get some done before bed, however I have done some personal developments today, so tracking them in here.

Today I was at an event to spread the word about the tech support project that I volunteer at on a Tuesday afternoons (It runs all week long), and to help give cyber security advice.

Not many people showed up during it, but it was still a day out. Going back to it tomorrow as well, just a different location.
