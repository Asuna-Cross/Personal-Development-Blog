Today's goals is to make a start on the javascript programming for the calculator project.

The project is winding me up in circles and I'm putting it to the side for now and working on other things before coming back to it with a fresher mind than I currently have for the project.

I'm feeling my own personal self being reluctant to code due to it, will be back when I feel better about it.
