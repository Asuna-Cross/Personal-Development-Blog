More work done on the calculator project.

The main questions being asked when I started it today was how was I going to be able to switch between variables and how to get the operators working.

I managed to get some semblance of pseudocode for this completed and into the project as a bare bones for the coding section. From here I need to refine it slightly and break down the code sections from being repeated everywhere to more broken down into managable sections for me to use.

Working on it more throughout another session and managed to get the pseudocode to a position where I feel ready to start coding next time I open it up, if that's later today or another day is to be decided.
