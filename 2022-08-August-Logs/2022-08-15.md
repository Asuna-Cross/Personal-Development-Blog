# The Odin Project - Java Fundamentals
Learning more about the fundamentals of javascript.

Today I have covered the material on functions, it has included return functions, paramaters, anonymous functions, expressions and arrow functions.

Looking at this from a security standpoint, I can see ways that it would be possible to use the agree buttons to implement suspicious code into your own website for phishing purposes without people noticing. This was an attack on scam websites that I read about a while ago but never looked into, however seeing the code laid out it makes it clear as to how it would be done.

> EXPRESSION VS DECLARATION
Declarations is a global function and can be called whenever. An expression is called upon and defined at the moment it is needed in the main code and only usable once the execution reaches that stage.

> "In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, itâ€™s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it." - javascript.info

> Arrow Functions
These can shorten things down whenever you use a =>, used in place of function expressions, or anonymous functions.

> Call Stacks
Java uses call stacks to manage functions, it uses the LIFO principle when doing so, Last In First Out.
