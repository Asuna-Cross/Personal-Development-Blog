# Weekend Catch up
Catching up on all the work I failed to finish last week, which is predominantely paperwork and updating my diary on things done during class.

# The Odin Project
Moving onto the fundamentals of Javascript.

Rabbit hole - The JavaScript information linked on variables touched on the "strict" mode of JavaScript and that some things won't work if you turn it on. Out of curiousity I looked up what this setting was and found out that it's due to security and optomisation.

Looking at variables, I didn't know how JavaScript specifically declared variables, I knew how other programs did, but not this one. Haing let and const seem quite logical.

The uppercase constants for variables seems like a useful thing to remember which I also hadn't came across until now.

Finished JavaScript Fundamentals part 1 and up to the assignments on part 2
