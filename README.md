## Personal Development Blog

> Blog documenting my personal development as I progress through the world of technology.

# About Me
In the past I have done computer science to a high level at high school, followed up by a game development course at university. A few years later and I was unable to use either, a few more years later and I'm on my way back to learning how to use them.

My previous history was originally in Visual Basic, followed by Flash and C++, as well as development on Unity and Scratch. Most of these skills are still present, however they are highly diminished and need brought back up to par.

Currently I volunteer doing technology support for those with little to no experience with computers.

# Goals
Within the next year I hope to start looking for entry level jobs in the fields of IT, either through web development, networking or IT support.

As a pathway towards this, I am looking for opportunities to grow and develop my personal skills, as well as chances to network and improve.
