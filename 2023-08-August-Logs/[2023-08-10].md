Woke up today and found out that my university coursework is due to arrive today, except I wasn't expecting any physical books for this module...
I'm really considering getting a full on bookcase in my flat for all my books and coursework, it would help a lot, especially with how many books I'm gathering from the OU.

# Intentions
- Proof read and publish Ansible part one blog post
- Check and start Japanese homework

# Ansible Post Proof Reading
That was pesky, I had to rewrite so much, but I think it's looking a lot more professional now and it's uploaded. I'll continue to improve my writing skills and hopefully make even better articles as the time goes on.
