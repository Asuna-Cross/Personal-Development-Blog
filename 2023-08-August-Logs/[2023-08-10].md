Woke up today and found out that my university coursework is due to arrive today, except I wasn't expecting any physical books for this module...
I'm really considering getting a full on bookcase in my flat for all my books and coursework, it would help a lot, especially with how many books I'm gathering from the OU.

# Intentions
- Proof read and publish Ansible part one blog post
- Check and start Japanese homework
