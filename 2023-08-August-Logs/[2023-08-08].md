Yesterday was a quiet day for work, while I got some done I didn't really write it up in my blog as being completed, but it is done.

I'm thinking about saving up and getting rid of my current desk and dining table and replacing them both with a proper study area for myself so that I can have a better place to study with a desk that doesn't wobble with my every movement, I'll see if I follow through on that or not though, I still need to get a new fridge-freezer since my one is broken.

# Intentions
- Finish Japanese homework
- Ansible blog post

# Japanese
Finished off my homework, this involved changing words to and from romaji and hiragana, as well as listening to spoken words and writing out the hiragana for them.
I've noticed that I know the kanji for some of the words already, so I might bring this up with my teacher tomorrow, as well as look into talking about the weather so I can respond to him in Japanese as well since it's a small baby step that I can take.

# Ansible Blog Post
I've just went and wrote a 1.5k word essay on how to make an ansible repo.

I'm pooped, but it's done, I've asked for some help to go over it and see if it's alright. I just want to see the end of this thing and move onto the next one. I hope people reading it will like it once it's done.
