Yesterday was a quiet day for work, while I got some done I didn't really write it up in my blog as being completed, but it is done.

I'm thinking about saving up and getting rid of my current desk and dining table and replacing them both with a proper study area for myself so that I can have a better place to study with a desk that doesn't wobble with my every movement, I'll see if I follow through on that or not though, I still need to get a new fridge-freezer since my one is broken.

# Intentions
- Finish Japanese homework
- Ansible blog post
