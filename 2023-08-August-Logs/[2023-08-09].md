Today has been one interesting day, I was slow to get going today.

# Intentions
- Make a start on the second blog for Ansible
- Proof read first blog for Ansible
- Check what Japanese homework has been left

# Employability Workshop - Resilience
Today's employability workshop was on building resilience, it was an interesting topic, and one I think I'll post up about on my blog as it's something that I deem to be important in my life.

Overall on the course there was nothing new if I'm honest, it was very bare bones, and not what I was expecting from the service that I've been using. I wish there was more to be added onto it.

The class ended quite early compared to how long it was due to go on for, so there was no rush on me making it back home in time for my Japanese lesson.

## Class
Had my lesson today, we covered the こそあど group, which is where to say where things are.

My teacher was surprised that I had done all of the homework already and didn't expect me to go over it all before the next lesson.

We did talk a bit about speed and my long term goals, he believes that by the time I graduate university that I'll be N3 level, saying that there's a giant leap between N4 and N3 that will take a long time to bridge.

# Ansible Blog
Asked friends to check over my Ansible blog part one for me and got the skeleton for Ansible blog part two started.
