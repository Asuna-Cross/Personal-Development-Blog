I had a look at my university modules again, it seems like I'll need to brush up on my web development skills again, so I'll look into that over next month to see what I can do in preperation for the course.

I've also asked about coding environments for the course, I currently use VSCode, and it's what I'm typing this up in the now. I found some themes I like as well.

If I can use my own envs, then I'm more than likely going to get a Vagrant base box working again to keep all my programming inside of it and out of my main machine in case I crash things, or learn to make containers, I used to do this when I first started using Python, I'll ask John about it again and see if he'll help me learn how to set it up again.

Do need to finish off my homework, if I wait too long then my teacher won't be able to mark it in time for my next class and I don't want to be *that student* I want to be a decent student who hands her homework in on time.

Also... Still listening to L'arc on repeat, this is a bad habit but oh well, at least Stay Away ~ Barbie Forest version ain't on, since I usually put that on repeat for quite some time (It's a good piano piece alright?)
