My workbooks for university arrived in the mail today, so I'm going to make a start on them. I know that the course doesn't start until October, however I want as much of a head start as possible so I have time in case I need to take it again.

Also, after all my revisions in my blog post yesterday I wasn't able to get any Japanese done, so will make a point of doing that today.

But hey, had a lovely cup of matcha and an almond croissant for breakfast, two things that I've been craving all week long.

This evening I do have an event to go to, there is an online breaking into cyber event in a discord server that I'm in (CJH), so I'm going to go to that and I hope it's as good as it says on the tin. These guys know their stuff so it should be.

# Intentions
- Read through the module guide
- Start Japanese homework
