Today has been a productive day offline, and time to finish the day by being as productive as possible online as well.

# Intentions
- First draft of the Ansible blog post
- Next section of Japanese homework started

# Ansible Blog Post
Went around finding more links to resources to put into it, however I think that they might be slightly too advanced for the group I'm going for.
