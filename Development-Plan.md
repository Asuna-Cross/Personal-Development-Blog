# Current learning plan

## Web Development
Following The Odin Project in order to learn about how to build websites, will be following to completion and taking the Java path once progression has been made.

Current Stage : Foundations

## Programming
Automate the Boring Things is the learning path to get back into learning programing languages. The choice to learn Python is due to how accessible the language is, and how widely used it is in my other area of expertise that I am building (physics).

After Python there is a possibility of going closer to the metal with moving to C++.

Current Stage : Chapter 7

## Networking and Hardware
Currently in the process of putting together a plan for how to learn networking and hardware. This will be updated once a plan is in place.
