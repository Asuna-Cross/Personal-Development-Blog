# Current learning plan

## Web Development
Following The Odin Project in order to learn about how to build websites, will be following to completion and taking the Ruby path once progression has been made.

Current Stage : Ruby

## Programming
Learning Ruby through The Odin Project

## Networking and Hardware
Currently in the process of putting together a plan for how to learn networking and hardware. This will be updated once a plan is in place.

## Cyber Security
Learning three basic areas one by one, currently on programming and using the Odin Project for this. Afterwards will look into doing SysAdmin or Networking. Will seek advice from others who have managed to succeed in the industry when the time comes.

## Notes and Changes To Learning plan
- Moved from the Java route to the Ruby route on the Odin Project as it is the more complete of the two paths to take and has more content to go through.
- Halted work on Python, Networking and Portswigger Academy - This is to give myself more time to focus and complete one area at a time.
- Cyber Security learning has a more straightforward path to follow, and will work my way up to being able to understand it properly.
