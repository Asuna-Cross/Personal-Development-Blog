# HTB Academy

Today has been working on the Windows Fundamentals from HackTheBox Academy.

Been learning about how file sharing permissions work and how traffic can be blocked by Windows Defender.
Due to lack of second screen (Not studying at home today), stopped part the way through. 

Finding that some of this is revision from my days of doing basic networking at high school. File and directory permissions are things that I did many years ago on my windows computers at school when I did my national highers.

To return to this section either later today (or weekend due to SQA course over the next couple days) when I have both screen available again to use.

> Later in the day confirmation, will return to Hack The Box later on in the weekend.

# The Odin Project

For the Odin project I have made a start on the landing page project, my dev environment for it has been crashing a lot today so it took some time to get it linked into github to get the repo set up. It's all online now and being worked on.

I've been able to complete the header for the project and making a move on the hero section. While I think it is turning out well so far, I can see some changes that I would like to make for the sake of making the project nicer looking. One main issue is having all the style sheets for all sections in the one place, as well as how difficult I've been making it with flexbox. I hope to simplify all of this once the code is written and I can revisit them all.

It has been made a lot simpler with the previous exercises involving CSS being similar to what the landing project has been about. I can also see this project being used later on in conjunction with the SQA course.

All of this has been saved and uploaded to my repo for today.
