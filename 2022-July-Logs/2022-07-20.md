# HTB Academy day

Today has been working on the Windows Fundamentals from HackTheBox Academy.

Been learning about how file sharing permissions work and how traffic can be blocked by Windows Defender.
Due to lack of second screen (Not studying at home today), stopped part the way through. 

Finding that some of this is revision from my days of doing basic networking at high school. File and directory permissions are things that I did many years ago on my windows computers at school when I did my national highers.

To return to this section either later today (or weekend due to SQA course over the next couple days) when I have both screen available again to use.
