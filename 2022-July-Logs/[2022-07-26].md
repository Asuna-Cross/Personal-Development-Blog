# Web Dev

Taking lessons learned from Odin so far this morning to put together the basics of a website-based CV for myself, which allows me to show off my developing skills as well as keeps the SQA happy for the course that I am currently on.

Already made is the header and footer, I need to have a think on what else to be able to put into this.
