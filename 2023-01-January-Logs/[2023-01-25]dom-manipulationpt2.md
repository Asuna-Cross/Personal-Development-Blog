# More DOM Manipulation through The Odin Project

Was able to sit and digest the information today, made it all the way through the lesson and completed the assignments.

It covered what DOM stands for and what it is, it then went over how to target nodes with selectors and finished off with how these can be used in useful ways using various pieces of code.

The exercises had me following a tutorial that was making a small drum kit using Javascript. It covered audio, event handling and also some animation as well.

Overall, I'm feeling quite confident with the material covered today and looking forward to being able to use it.

Took a peak at the next lesson, it is material that I have already covered in my own personal searching.

I've tackled git branching in many of my own projects that I have been working on.

Next time I load up Odin Project will be the Etch-A-Sketch program for my portfolio.

I will have a think on it overnight as to how to make this and then see about putting it into practice.
