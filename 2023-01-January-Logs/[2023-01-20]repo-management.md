# Downloading Repos

Finishing off the VM today by checking what repos I need to download and getting them done, after that I will be updating my code cookbook with needed syntax that I collected from making a box.

Repos needed to make local clone of - 

- Dev cookbook [X]
- Personal Development Blog [X]
- Javascript Exercises [X]

Other tasks

-Set-up Jest []

It went well enough to download the repos, there were some issues when it came to starting it back up with the SSH key, however I found out how to do them pretty easily and now they are working again.

Also updated my cookbook with some code snippets from creating this base box.

Thinking of stopping for the night due to the late start for today, and will come back to this next day I have time to start fresh on Javascript.
