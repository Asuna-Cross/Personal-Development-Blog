# Back to Basics

After a long hard think, I decided that I was focusing on too many areas of study at the same time. As a result of this, I have decided to cut back on what I'm doing and focus on one area at a time, get that area up high enough to be on maintenence and then continue with another area. So for now I'm going to complete the Odin Project as I'm nearly half-way through the project, with a few pieces left before I complete fundamentals and move onto picking the route that I will be going down.

# Virtual Machines

Today I worked on getting an Xubuntu box put together for Vagrant so that I have something that I can keep coming back to when needed for my progress through The Odin Project.

The box will have all the software needed for me to complete the fundamentals section of the course and will be updated once I've decided which path to go down and need to install for that as well.

The link to the box will be made public once it is made.
