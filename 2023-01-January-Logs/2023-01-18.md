# More Base Box Building

My mentor tried my base box build that I uploaded last time and confirmed that it wasn't working and was throwing errors. Looking over it I had made mistakes in implementing it, I also picked the wrong version of Xubuntu to install onto the machine as well.

Created a new machine using Xubuntu 22.04 instead now, during the session with my mentor we managed to get the OS installed and get guest additions running as needed.

Also started to learn about snapshots and how to use them, now implemented them into my base box.

Thinking about putting base boxes to the side for now to focus on web development and then come back to them once I'm doing sysadmin work.

This seems like the most logical path to take.
