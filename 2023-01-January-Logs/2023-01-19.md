# Finishing Off Box

Decision was made to put aside the attempt to turn the box into a vagrant box for now and focus on getting it set up and usable for Odin Project.

Today will be installing everything that is needed and then see where I left off with Odin Project, might backtrack a bit on the project so that I can revise before moving forward, will decide when it's time.

- Git [X]
- VSCode [X]
- Chrome [X]
- Node [X]
- Bitwarden [X]
- Burp [X]

Box is finished for now with all the updates requested. It has been turned off and a snapshot made of the program.

Remembered, need to link to github.

Managed to create the SSH keypair and is now linked to github.

Tasks for next time - Get repos needed downloaded.
