# Finishing Off Box

Decision was made to put aside the attempt to turn the box into a vagrant box for now and focus on getting it set up and usable for Odin Project.

Today will be installing everything that is needed and then see where I left off with Odin Project, might backtrack a bit on the project so that I can revise before moving forward, will decide when it's time.
