# Code Wars
Today I'm hoping to train JavaScript in Code Wars as I've realised that I've forgotten a lot of it and want to brush up again before I move onto doing more Ruby.

Completed two Kata with relative ease on the 8 kyu level. One was to replace a character in a string and the other was to flip the sign of a number.

Completed seven Kata on code wars in total today, I enjoyed them and learnt a bit from seeing how others have tackled the same problems.

# The Odin Project
Finished off the installation section needed for debugging and completed the exercises needed for the debugging section.

Being honest, most of the mistakes I was able to notice without using any of the debuggers except for stack trace... This feels like a gloat...

Onto the next section - basic enumerable methods. This will be interesting as I'm not used to this word so I don't know what this will be.

(On another note, I'm past the 25% mark of completion for Ruby)

So, I went back to Odin after dinner, I'm extremely dissapointed in TOP for this lesson. I can get a joke, but this page has entered mean girl territory and the joke just isn't funny anymore and is rubbing me up the wrong way and not being useful or helpful at all.

I've skipped straight to the assignment section to read the other resources on the topic as this is just bullshit.

# Notes
Reminder to self to take a new snapshot of my env after having installed things onto it.
