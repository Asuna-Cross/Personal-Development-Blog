Had a busy day, got a new position at volunteering, will talk about it further down.

Also had a dinner that I was proud of making. It was a take on soboro don, except I had no chicken so it used beef instead. Chicken mince is super hard to find here in Scotland.

Feeling a lot better compared to the past couple of days and so intend to get more work done.

# Volunteering
Today at volunteering there was a meeting for the new project starting up, it's a place for people to come and interact with others while having a cup of tea and a cake.

It seems to be interesting, the concept is to help combat lonliness that has been happening due to isolation. As a volunteer I'd be responsible for helping to set up and clean up after everyone as well as interacting with all who show up and manage the conversations so that everyone is included and heard.
