Today has been a bad weather day here in Scotland, lots of harr and rain all day. Made me wonder what I should do to make my windows look happier even when outside isn't the greatest.

Might look into little lights to go on the windowsill, at the very least buying new candles to go up there as it's lovely to have them up.

Also might look at some things to stick on the window, like light catchers, they can also be pretty when it comes to other things too.

Would also like some more art and things on the walls too, but also, landlord... I still want that pegboard.

All plans for future! And things to keep in mind going forward.

# Intentions
- Poke at Tic-Tac-Toe some more
- Think on structure of learning from here on out and try to get something in place
- Check the job market
