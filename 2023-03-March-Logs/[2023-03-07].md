Today has been a day of social interactions and inspiration.

However, now it's time to get to work. I feel like this diary could use some more information, so anything professional can go in here now I think.

# Today's intentions

- Make a start on the thought process for Tic-Tac-Toe
- Complete at least one kata on CodeWars
- Go back over Shirokuma Cafe Ep 1 and see how much has been retained
