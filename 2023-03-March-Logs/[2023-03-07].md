Today has been a day of social interactions and inspiration.

However, now it's time to get to work. I feel like this diary could use some more information, so anything professional can go in here now I think.

# Today's intentions

- Make a start on the thought process for Tic-Tac-Toe
- Complete at least one kata on CodeWars
- Go back over Shirokuma Cafe Ep 1 and see how much has been retained

# Tic Tac Toe Project

It appears that I've lost the code for the Tic-Tac-Toe project that I did while working my way through Automate The Boring Stuff.

This is pesky, it would have saved a lot of time and working out if I still had it.

Found it, however it only shows how to display the board, not to check for win conditions, so this will need more thought than I had first planned.

# Shirokuma Cafe

I remembered a lot more than expected! I was able to sit through the entire episode and only get lost a couple of times. Will move onto the next episode next time and keep my learning going along the Japanese track for languages.
