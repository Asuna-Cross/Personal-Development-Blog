Back onto TOP for the Ruby projects.

Onto the basic ruby projects for now, the first two were simple enough, the stock picker one is slightly confusing, but hopefully I will understand it better next time I pick it up (Time for dinner when this is being wrote)

VS Code seems to be breaking and not picking up when I'm doing changes to my diary, will troubleshoot this later.

# Update

The git section of the diary was corrupted, thus loosing all changes that have been done over the past 24hrs.

# TOP and CodeWars

Finished up the basic ruby exercises on The Odin Project today, these can be seen in my repo with the same name. It was interesting to find out new things.

Worked on CodeWars for a bit too, managed to level up my JavaScript and was working on a Ruby project in which it would output the correct thing and how they wanted it, but I failed the test because it wasn't in the right format.

Last minute, about to give up, managed to solve it.
