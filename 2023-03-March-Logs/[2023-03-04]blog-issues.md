Back onto TOP for the Ruby projects.

Onto the basic ruby projects for now, the first two were simple enough, the stock picker one is slightly confusing, but hopefully I will understand it better next time I pick it up (Time for dinner when this is being wrote)

VS Code seems to be breaking and not picking up when I'm doing changes to my diary, will troubleshoot this later.

# Update

The git section of the diary was corrupted, thus loosing all changes that have been done over the past 24hrs.
