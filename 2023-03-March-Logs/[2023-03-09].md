Today has been a slow day.

It was a tough night for me with not much sleep, and what sleep I did have wasn't very pleasent, so woke up not feeling right.

Spent the afternoon doing self-care and looking after myself... and then a snowstorm hit my town before going away just as quickly as it came on. It was lovely to see and I sat and watched it while sipping on a cup of tea.

Feeling refreshed now, getting work done before dinner time and seeing what I can accomplish.

# Intentions
- Either get the broken code working for Tic-Tac-Toe or finish coming up with my own code
- Shirokuma Cafe Ep 2

# Shirokuma Cafe
Ep 2 went well, watched the first half again and was understanding it a little bit more.

# CodeWars
Completed three level 6 kyu kata in Ruby today.

They were really fun, one was on the Tower of Hanoi, another was based on going for a walk and the final one was looking at binary.
