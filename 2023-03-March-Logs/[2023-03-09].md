Today has been a slow day.

It was a tough night for me with not much sleep, and what sleep I did have wasn't very pleasent, so woke up not feeling right.

Spent the afternoon doing self-care and looking after myself... and then a snowstorm hit my town before going away just as quickly as it came on. It was lovely to see and I sat and watched it while sipping on a cup of tea.

Feeling refreshed now, getting work done before dinner time and seeing what I can accomplish.

# Intentions
- Either get the broken code working for Tic-Tac-Toe or finish coming up with my own code
- Shirokuma Cafe Ep 2
- Sort out Cookbook

# Shirokuma Cafe
Ep 2 went well, watched the first half again and was understanding it a little bit more.

# CodeWars
Completed three level 6 kyu kata in Ruby today.

They were really fun, one was on the Tower of Hanoi, another was based on going for a walk and the final one was looking at binary.

# Cookbook
Going to be doing work getting my cookbook up and running as it has been neglected.

Created sections for each of the three programming languages that I'm currently learning and started adding in short programs from each for a simple reference for later.
