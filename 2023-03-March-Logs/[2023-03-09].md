Today has been a slow day.

It was a tough night for me with not much sleep, and what sleep I did have wasn't very pleasent, so woke up not feeling right.

Spent the afternoon doing self-care and looking after myself... and then a snowstorm hit my town before going away just as quickly as it came on. It was lovely to see and I sat and watched it while sipping on a cup of tea.

Feeling refreshed now, getting work done before dinner time and seeing what I can accomplish.
