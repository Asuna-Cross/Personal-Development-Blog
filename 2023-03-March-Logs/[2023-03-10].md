Today has been a relaxing day, I have been out and doing self-care for most of the day before sitting down to do studying with my mentor.

# Intentions
- Finish updating Cookbook
- Check for updates on VM
- Shirokuma Cafe Ep 2

# Cookbook
Looked over my old projects and have an idea of projects to move over, however will be postponing that until I feel like it is needed.

# Productivity Website
Made the repo for the website, keeping it private until it is ready to be deployed as a first pass.

Added the HTML boilerplate as well as the stylesheets. Also wrote down the features and tasks in which I want and need to complete.

# Shirokuma Cafe
Rewatched the first part of Ep 2

# PentesterLab Bootcamp
Going through the reading list for the Linux and Scripting section.

Got halfway through the Wikipedia page on HTTP.
