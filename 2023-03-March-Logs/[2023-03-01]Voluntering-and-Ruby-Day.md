# Volunteering Event
Took part in the event to promote the data bank and the library services again today.

No students showed up, however I was able to talk to college staff members about the services and got some of them interested in sending people our way.

Recieved feedback from the event through the volunteer manager at the library who informed me that she had had very positive feedback from the event managers regarding my manner and presentation at the event. Since then I am going to be switching positions at the library from doing the basic tech support to doing networking and events for the volunteer services.

# The Odin Project
Back home from the event and into coding. To finish off the methods exercises and hopefully move onto the debugging section tonight.

Going through the method exercises, need to remember to spell variables correctly, most errors so far tonight have been due to misspelling things.

Finished the method exercises, so far so good. I'm not getting caught up in things and it's working out well.

Debugging reminds me that I used to be a tester on a video game, if you're reading this and want to see, it is a game called "The 39 Steps" made by TernTV.

Pry-byebug is an interesting concept to me, I'm looking forward to playing with it after reading all the rest of the resources in the assignment for debugging.

Installing the gems and didn't realise that I needed to change some of my settings for Ruby to work with Zsh instead of Bash so it threw errors until I worked it out.

# Termnial Work
Bash was starting to annoy me, so I've learned how to install Zsh and it is now installed as well as OhMyZsh and it has been made pretty.

# CodeWars

Completed two Javascript Kata in order to keep it fresh and to try to upgrade myself while away from the learning on TOP.

One was to count by X and the other was to determine if a number was even or odd.

Completed the Even or Odd in Ruby as well.
