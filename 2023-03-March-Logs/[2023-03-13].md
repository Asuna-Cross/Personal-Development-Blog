Today has been a very productive day, woke up feeling refreshed (when I eventually woke up, been napping off headaches), so took it out on my room.

Cleaned the main productive areas up, got the floor under the desks cleaned too, which haven't been done since friends put things under them.

Also put up some little pictures behind my computer and brought my fidget toy selection back out in the hopes of making a more inspiring workspace. I figure since I spend so much time in this section of my room that it should be inspiring.
