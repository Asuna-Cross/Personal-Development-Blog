Today has been a very productive day, woke up feeling refreshed (when I eventually woke up, been napping off headaches), so took it out on my room.

Cleaned the main productive areas up, got the floor under the desks cleaned too, which haven't been done since friends put things under them.

Also put up some little pictures behind my computer and brought my fidget toy selection back out in the hopes of making a more inspiring workspace. I figure since I spend so much time in this section of my room that it should be inspiring.


# Today's Intentions

# Study Project
Cleaned up the to-do list and managed to get it working after a bit of trying.
Looking into the notes section now.
Going to modify the to-do list section code for a notes section..

# Shirokuma Cafe Ep 3
Taking the time to put sentences on repeat so that I can listen to them closer for studying the words to get them into my mind more.
