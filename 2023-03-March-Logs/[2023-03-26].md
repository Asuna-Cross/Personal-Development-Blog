Today I'm on my computer before it's dark out, so going to use this time to do pentesterlab academy when I can see my screen properly.

I'm enjoying the fact that it's lighter for longer outside now that we're past the spring equinox, the clocks going forward yesterday threw me for a loop a little bit today. However will be evened up soon.

Going to take it easier today and finish up Anki and Japanese and then call it quits for the day to relax.

# Pentesterlab Academy
I realised that I had forgotten how to get to the etc directory in ubuntu, for my own future reference, go down two directories from where you start in a terminal.

Went through the tutorial from Ubuntu shared in yesterday's journal entry.

Thinking that it might be a good idea to add these into my cookbook, will look at that a bit more in a bit.

# Japanese
This anki deck is interesting, the adults seem to be making the rounds a lot if you follow the sentences, one man has six kids and a woman has three.
