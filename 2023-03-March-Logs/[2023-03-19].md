Happy times, it has been over 21 days of me updating this daily and giving daily updates. To me, this is a huge step forward.

While I've done different amounts every day, the fact that I'm still here and doing things is a massive step in the right direction, and I'm beginning to look forward to coming on to do tech work and write about it in here.

# Intentions
- Debugging Code

# Job Hunting
I had a recruiting agency get in touch with me on LinkedIn to let me know about their services, so looked into that and will be applying for some jobs through them, which is all good there.

Heard nothing back about any other position I have applied for.
