Introverted mood today, will be keeping head down and working away on my own today.

# Japanese Study
Back to reading more of Kimi no Na wa, managed to make it up to page 18 of chapter one, it's interesting and funny so far, I'm enjoying the art style a lot as well.

Went back to the book of short stories that I have and beginning to read the first one, it's "Concerning the Sound of a Train Whistle in the Night *or* On the Efficacy of Fiction" by Murakami Haruki.

It's an interesting story so far, I just need to remember to read down and not across, which is throwing me for a loop trying to keep up a bit, however it will come with time.

I've made it to the boy waking up in the middle of the night, will come back to it in a little bit.

# Notion
I spent the rest of the night gathering up all my resources and putting them into my notion for easy reference, it's getting quite big now with everything I've gathered up, I'm hoping that they don't limit the size of personal accounts any time soon, I wouldn't want to have to give up my resources.
