Today I'm hoping to start on the resources for TOP's OOP course, after that my plan is to do more on CodeWars and see if I can make progress on the Ruby track.

So far the couse is tacking inheritance from other areas and variable scopes. A lot of this can be seen as revision from other areas. However, it is still good to know how to do this in Ruby.

Completed Codecademy section 9, took a bit longer than expected, but was good to go through.

Bruh! My code matches the Codecademy code letter to letter but it's still throwing out errors...

Completed some more of the reading for TOP, and rejoined the Ruby server on discord as I'm now actively learning the language.

Went back to Code Wars and levelled up my Ruby skills to 7 kyu after doing a level 8 kyu kata followed by a level 6 kyu kata. I will try to keep a habit of doing kata going to keep all my skills fresh.
