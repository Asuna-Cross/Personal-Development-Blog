Today has been a day.

# Intentions
- Japanese
- Some form of coding
- Job Hunting

# Japanese
Completed Anki for the day, the deck is going well so far, I'm at a point where I used to get mixed up with the words a lot, so I have retained information about them quite well, this time around with paying more attention as well I'm figuring out the readings easier on words I haven't seen in a while.

Watched episode 3 of Shirokuma Cafe again to consolidate learning from today, I'm still enjoying the jokes and will move onto episode four sometime next week.

# Job Hunting
Went on the lookout for jobs, found nothing that I can make it to with travelling while searching Indeed today.

# Code Wars
Decided to go back through and complete the 8 kyu kata in order to get my mind more focused and settled on going forward with Ruby as I have been having mental blocks on the language.
