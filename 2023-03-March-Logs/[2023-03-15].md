Today has been another productive day outside of technology, the cleaning spree is continuing and is going well so far.

A very late start of the day for intentions and getting down with coding and Japanese learning, so not much will be done tonight with more being done tomorrow.

Was unable to do either, instead did lots more personal development outside of coding.

- Do a little bit of both
