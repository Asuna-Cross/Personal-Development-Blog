Today I've been physically unwell, I'm not long awake and settled enough to get some work done.

There are no intentions today due to me taking it gently and not knowing how much I'll be able to complete in one sitting.

Hopefully things will clear up quickly and I'll be able to be up to full steam ahead again.
