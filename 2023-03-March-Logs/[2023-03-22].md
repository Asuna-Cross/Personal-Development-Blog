Holy hell, I'm awake early and doing work in the morning.

Must be something screwey with the brain, heh...

Anyway, yes, I'm here and I'm early!

# Japanese Study
Y'know what, let's do something crazy, let's check off my Anki, I've not done this in so long it's going to be pain.

I reset the anki deck as it has been too long since I did it last, and after that I did today's cards.

Going back to using Anki as I believe it is the best way to reach N1 level as I don't want to pay for WaniKani.

Went through the reading for stage one, I don't think the information will fully stick until I'm using it more as my brain tends to forget things unless it can use them.
