# Volunteering Event
Took part in the event to promote the data bank and the library services again today.

No students showed up, however I was able to talk to college staff members about the services and got some of them interested in sending people our way.

Recieved feedback from the event through the volunteer manager at the library who informed me that she had had very positive feedback from the event managers regarding my manner and presentation at the event. Since then I am going to be switching positions at the library from doing the basic tech support to doing networking and events for the volunteer services.

# The Odin Project
Back home from the event and into coding. To finish off the methods exercises and hopefully move onto the debugging section tonight.
