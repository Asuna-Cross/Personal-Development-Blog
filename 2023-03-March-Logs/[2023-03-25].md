Been a slow day, caught up on cleaning and friends, so has been good.

# Job Hunt
Went onto Indeed and there was nothing new in the area.

Got invited to hand in a CV on linkedin, however the job was down in England while I'm up in Scotland, a bit too far to travel daily...

# Odin Project - Mastermind Project
While this game was known when I was a kid, I never got to play it with other people.

Getting myself familure with the rules and going to see if there's any live version that I can play with to get more common with how it works.

# Japanese
Completed Anki for the day, the words today were around the words and kanji, 見、耳、上げる、止める、体、白い, among others, I should take the time to try to make simple sentences in here with the words I'm learning, it would help to solidify things a bit more than just memorising the words in Anki.

Watched some videos on youtube about my favourite Japanese girlband - Raise a Suilen. Also watched a bit of an interview from my favourite boyband - L'arc~en~ciel
