Not been well today, however I think this is the final day in a row in which I've been unwell and things should start looking up from here onwards.

Today's going to be a simple day for tasks and things to do.

# Intentions
- Continue to debug tic-tac-toe

# Employability
Searched jobs today and updated my linkedin profile to include what I'm currently working on.

# Gen Tech
Laptop is being very slow today, will need to see what is causing it to come to some sort of solution as the virtual machine I use for coding is crashing and lagging.
