Today I had my very first networking event, only four of us showed up and I already knew one lady, so it wasn't networking that well, but I did however get to talk to people and get some social time away from my laptop which was a good thing.

My university has also gotten back in touch to confirm my course change and so I'm now registered on the cyber security course, I just need to wait for it to update on my student home and from there I can register for the modules I need to complete year one.

# Intentions
- Anki
- Pentesterlab Academy

# Japanese
Finished up doing Anki cards for today's Japanese lesson, followed it on by watching more Shirokuma Cafe in order to make use of what I'm learning.

Going back to Anki with Shirokuma Cafe at the same time seems to be a good way to consolidate learning.

# Job Hunting
Not much new online, at least not in my area, so nothing for me to apply to today.

# Pentesterlab Academy
I completely forgot I had already installed burpsuite onto my main VM, oopsie... hehe...
Ah well, burpsuite is installed, now to figure out how to install Apache onto my machine.
...
Apache came pre-installed onto my installation of Xubuntu, so that makes a whole lot of things easier on my end.
