Today I had my very first networking event, only four of us showed up and I already knew one lady, so it wasn't networking that well, but I did however get to talk to people and get some social time away from my laptop which was a good thing.

My university has also gotten back in touch to confirm my course change and so I'm now registered on the cyber security course, I just need to wait for it to update on my student home and from there I can register for the modules I need to complete year one.
