Today I've went to volunteering and been productive outside of it.

I let my creative side show with arts and crafts, it's fun to make things with your hands every now and again.

# Intentions
- Shirokuma Cafe
- Study Env Website

# Study Env Website
Made some changes to the notes code by looking at what the to-do list code had that the notes wouldn't and removed it to see if it will work like that.

# Jobs
Applied for a couple of jobs as a junior level developer and as an intern as well.

# Shirokuma Cafe
Rewatched episode two to get a better grasp of vocab as I'm aware that I'm not taking the time to get the individual words into my mind which will slow down or halt my progress if I don't address it.
