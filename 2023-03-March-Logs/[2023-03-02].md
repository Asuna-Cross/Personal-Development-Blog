# Code Wars
Today I'm hoping to train JavaScript in Code Wars as I've realised that I've forgotten a lot of it and want to brush up again before I move onto doing more Ruby.

Completed two Kata with relative ease on the 8 kyu level. One was to replace a character in a string and the other was to flip the sign of a number.

Completed seven Kata on code wars in total today, I enjoyed them and learnt a bit from seeing how others have tackled the same problems.

# The Odin Project
Finished off the installation section needed for debugging and completed the exercises needed for the debugging section.

Being honest, most of the mistakes I was able to notice without using any of the debuggers except for stack trace... This feels like a gloat...

Onto the next section - basic enumerable methods. This will be interesting as I'm not used to this word so I don't know what this will be.

(On another note, I'm past the 25% mark of completion for Ruby)


# Notes
Reminder to self to take a new snapshot of my env after having installed things onto it.
