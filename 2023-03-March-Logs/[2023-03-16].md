Today has been a low energy day, so will try to take it easy with pomodoros.

# Intentions
- Cure Dolly Videos
- Some form of coding
- Little bit of job hunting

# Job Hunting
Found one job to apply for today, so applied for it.
Fingers crossed, but hoping that there will be a higher chance of getting a job once I'm more skilled.

# The Odin Project
Spend some time debugging the Tic-Tac-Toe program, will go back to it again tomorrow to see if I can finish debugging it.

# Japanese Learning
Spent some time listening to native speakers talking in interviews today.
