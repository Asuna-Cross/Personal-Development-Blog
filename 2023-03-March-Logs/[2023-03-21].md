Been a small day today, been looking up a lot of things.

# Intentions
- Look at job adverts
- Look up how to get visa
- Little bit of programming

# Job Adverts
Applied for one tech related job, and saw a job for a tech role that I would be interested in however not at the skill level.

Used it to see what employers are looking for skills wise so that I can tailor my skills to what is needed and not learn things that people aren't as interested in.

# Visa
Japanese visa, it's a lifelong goal of mine, so looked up how to get one.

Lots of notes later, a plan of action for me has been written up so I can try to make this a reality. Going to go full ass into this one to make it before I turn 35.
