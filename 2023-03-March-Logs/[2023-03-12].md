Slow day, been very cold again today due to the cold snap happening in the country.

Got a few songs stuck in my head that just won't quit it today, hopefully I can get it to calm down eventually, or just give in. Not too sure yet.

The songs are Calling by Vamps (JPN) and Don't Be Afraid by L'arc~en~ciel.

- Shirokuma Cafe Ep 3
