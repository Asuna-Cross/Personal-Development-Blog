# Break

Been on a break from coding the past few days. Last Wednesday I had an exam resit to do and afterwards I had my birthday and then the weekend, so there hasn't been much time to work in between all of that.

# The Odin Project

Continuing on with the Javascript problems from Fundamentals Part 4. So far it is interesting just how much I've forogtten because I've not been keeping up with it all.

It's showing that more and more I need to have a daily habit of coding and keeping going with coding so that I don't forget everything that I am learning in the meantime.

Currently on task 3, string reverse. I have laid out on paper what I need to do and found the code snippets to do so, now I just need to turn it all into code and get it working. Which is what I hope to do this pomo.

It worked! I'm so happy to see that it is working, fixing small tasks like that does give a boost to the confidence, which I guess is what they are wanting to happen. Time to see how far through the rest I can get.
