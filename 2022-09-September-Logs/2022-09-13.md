# Portswigger Academy
Today I completed the labs for examining the database using SQL attacks.
There was one lab that I was unable to complete for some reason, nothing I would do worked, I also looked at community solutions and nothing came up for it, I've asked for support from others and will see what happens.

The labs saw me trying to look at databases for passwords stored in them to login as admin as proof of completion.

I had given myself until tomorrow to complete this, however managed it in a couple of hours. Will look at the timings I've given myself for the academy over the next few sessions and see what is a good speed level.
