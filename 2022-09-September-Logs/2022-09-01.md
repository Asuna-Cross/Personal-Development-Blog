# The Odin Project

Completed the Rock Paper Scissors project, overall it went well.

In order to complete it I used pen and paper to write down all my thoughts and sketches for how to write the code, and then once ready I outlined it all in pseudocode before coding it all. I found that this made the process go quite quickly and it was ready within a couple of hours of starting the project proper.

The end results of this can be seen in my github repos.
