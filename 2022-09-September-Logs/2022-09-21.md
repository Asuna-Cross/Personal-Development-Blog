 # Over The Wire - Bandit Game
 Got distracted by resources on my way to check Kali updates and started playing the Bandit Game.
 Really enjoying it, made it to level 6 log on and stopping for a while now.

Finished up to level 11 before lunch, now going back onto it, decided to use WSL for this as it's already set up and is less bother than spinning up on of my VMs for the challenge.

Manged to complete up to level 11, level 12 seems more difficult than expected. Well, it's new and new things take time to learn. With that decided that it was a good stopping point.
