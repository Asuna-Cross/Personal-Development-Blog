The challenge for removing more than one object from an array is proving harder than it looks, either that or I need more learning.
I'm able to get one element removed, however it is failing with all the other ones so far, so will need to look into how to solve that issue.

The results showed that there was an issue with not catching all the variables, talked to someone more experienced than me and he assisted me in solving the problem.
