Made it a full month of logging and onto April now, time sure does fly doesn't it?

Been thinking of the though "If you don't take time for your body then it will force you into taking more time off", I think that's true, I think I need to have a good balance between study and sleep in order to full function, and especially at the rate that I wish to function at.
