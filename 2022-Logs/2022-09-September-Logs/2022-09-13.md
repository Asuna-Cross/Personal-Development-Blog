# Portswigger Academy
Today I completed the labs for examining the database using SQL attacks.
There was one lab that I was unable to complete for some reason, nothing I would do worked, I also looked at community solutions and nothing came up for it, I've asked for support from others and will see what happens.

The labs saw me trying to look at databases for passwords stored in them to login as admin as proof of completion.

I had given myself until tomorrow to complete this, however managed it in a couple of hours. Will look at the timings I've given myself for the academy over the next few sessions and see what is a good speed level.

# The Odin Project
Working on the Javascript exercises from Fundamentals part 4, so far so good. I've been able to do the first two, and now for the third one I have figured out what I need to do, I just need to work out how to put it all down into code.

# Others
Been looking for new volunteering and also places to study outside of my house. Both have turned up not much. Also hoping to see if there are any chances to network with people in the local area and wider afield as well.
