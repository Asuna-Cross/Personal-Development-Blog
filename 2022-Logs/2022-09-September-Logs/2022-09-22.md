# Personal Development day

Today has been a day for personal development aand growth outside of coding.

Was looking into working out exactly what path I wish to go down for cyber security and web development and what job role I would like to aim for.

On top of this, was looking at ways of becoming more effective with my study, how to gain better networking skills and to make my goals.

I think I have it worked out, however will task myself with looking back and seeing what has been done.
