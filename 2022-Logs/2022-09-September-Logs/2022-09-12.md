# Reflection

I'm finding that it's becoming a bit challenging at times to know what to work on day by day and to not get distracted by other things going on. But on the flip side, it's also hard to keep up motivation when you're unemployed with no guidelines for how to spend your time.

In order to combat this, I feel as though some work elsewhere needs to be done. As a result of this, I'm going to take the time the now to look over and make a schedule for myself of when I want to complete things by.

As it starts, I wants to be able to say I have done the following by the end of the year

- Complete Foundations on The Odin Project
- Be 20% through the learning material for Portswigger Academy
- Have the failed CV website up and running properly
- Sending at least one commit a day during working days to github, even if it is just this development blog.

These goals are low for now as I'm unsure as to the outcome of my doctors appointments and everything else I need to do.

After these goals have been completed then the next levels would be

- Move onto Ruby on Rails section of The Odin Project
- Make it to 50% completion of Portswigger Academy
- Start on networking and virutal machine basics

From there on, build up to being able to find employment, for now, I'm not ready, but I will be soon (hopefully)

Going to use the goal setting on Study Stream to start breaking down daily and weekly goals to complete these tasks.
