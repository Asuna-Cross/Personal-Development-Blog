Yesterday there was an issue with my github on my web development vagrant box, today I have been looking through the errors to find out what was wrong.

Information shown was that there has been issues with both the vagrant box being depreciated, to the point that my box was unable to update itself, even the OS was having problems with it from within. And due to not keeping track of code one software was no longer suitable to download and was throwing errors as well.

Struggling to find a box with the same OS as the one I was using, so perhaps look into making my own vagrant boxes.
