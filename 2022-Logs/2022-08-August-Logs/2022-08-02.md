Today I'm allowing myself to rabbit hole into various areas of interest to see what I can learn, it's a day off from the robust schedule of the other days.

# VPNs
Rabbit holed into the world of VPNs, will use this to keep track of questions I have and the answers I find.

> What does a VPN do?
It lets you view the internet through someone else's computer and sends the data back via encryption to you.

> Why do they store data if they're not making a profit off of it?

# SSL
There was issues with the SSL certs at the public cafe that I go to, looked more into what that issue could be and discussed it with others.

# Man in the Middle Attacks
Learned more about what they are and what they do.
It seems the coffee shop website is possibly doing something similar and it is noticed on some websites compared to others.

# Guest Wifi
Learned that this is a thing that you should set up for anyone coming to visit your home that you don't trust to be able to fully set up their digital equipment properly.
I wasn't aware that this is a thing that you can do and might look into doing it myself when I have a proper internet connection at my house as currently using a mobile hotspot for internet.
