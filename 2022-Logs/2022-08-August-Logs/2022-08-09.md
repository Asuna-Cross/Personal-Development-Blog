# Cyber Security - SQL Injection
Learning about the basics of SQL Injection and learned how to do a basic injection, including how to query a database and how to gather information from it.

> Personal Note
I'm finding cyber security and web development to be like maths in a way. It's full of puzzles to learn and you only get better by solving them and taking full interest in the puzzles at hand. The learning curve can be steep, but once it clicks, it really does click.
