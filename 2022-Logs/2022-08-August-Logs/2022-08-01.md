# Weekend Catch up
Catching up on all the work I failed to finish last week, which is predominantely paperwork and updating my diary on things done during class.

# The Odin Project
Moving onto the fundamentals of Javascript.

Rabbit hole - The JavaScript information linked on variables touched on the "strict" mode of JavaScript and that some things won't work if you turn it on. Out of curiousity I looked up what this setting was and found out that it's due to security and optomisation.

Looking at variables, I didn't know how JavaScript specifically declared variables, I knew how other programs did, but not this one. Haing let and const seem quite logical.

The uppercase constants for variables seems like a useful thing to remember which I also hadn't came across until now.

Finished JavaScript Fundamentals part 1 and up to the assignments on part 2

# Hack the Box
Reading through Windows Fundamentals, starting to have issues with connecting to target machine more and more, going to need to investigate if it is an issue with using public wifi or if there is something more going on at my end to cause issues.
