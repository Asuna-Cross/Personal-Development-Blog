# Organisation

This morning has been all about organisation, I've made a start on making my own personal library of resources needed for technology and all other related things.

I chose to do that this morning to help get me back into a way of working, I've taken the past few days off due to not being in a mentally good position to be able to work, however I hope to make up for that today.

# Virtual Machines

Went more into Vagrant, seeing what more I can do with it with my current set up. I found out about all the settings that can be changed with VirtualBox.

From there I have moved onto learning about WSL with the aim to get ansible up and running on my machine for further automation of my virtual machines to see how far I can push them (And to have my development machines back as well)

Currently in the process of installing and configuring WSL for the first time.

Learning a lot so far about how windows and linux operate and the software that only runs on one or the other.

I got crashing, it's late and I just want to sleep, so switching learning topics for a bit before heading to bed. Other topics won't be tech related however so today's post ends.
