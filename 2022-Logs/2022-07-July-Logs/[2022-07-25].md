# Hack The Box Academy

Continuing on from last time with NTFS and File Permissions for windows.

Last time I was struggling to connect from windows, managed to download the package needed into my personal pwnbox to continue with the course.

> For information, I am not using their inbuilt pwnbox, I have made an environment using Kali Linux that launches via Vagrant to be able to learn with so that I can learn on something that I'll keep using.

Not much was done today, I took ill during the session and had to stop.
