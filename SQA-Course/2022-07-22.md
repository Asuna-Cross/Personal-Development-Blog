# Morning Session
Due to staffing issues, morning session was cancelled.

# Afternoon Session

Most of the class didn't appear for the class due to transport issues (The busses have been getting cancelled constantly here due to short staff), as a result there was not much teaching work being done and we were left to our own devices.

Personally I finished off the end of the landing page for The Odin Project, the lecturer has suggested that I use lessons learned from that to create my own CV page from scratch, I'm inclined to do so as it would be a good show of my ability and I can add to it as I progress.
