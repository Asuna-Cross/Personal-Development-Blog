# Morning Session

Free working session, worked on the cv more. Looked for ideas for how to display my work history and found one I liked.

No access to VS Code today so code has been added to the repo and will be deleted if it doesn't work.

# Afternoon Session

Afternoon session was a brief overview of what is required for us for moving images, however class was cut short due to teaching issues.
