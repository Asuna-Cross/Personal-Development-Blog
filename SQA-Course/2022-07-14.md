# New Course Day

Starting a new course today to develop personal and employable skills.

## Morning Session

Morning session went over our brief for the next 8 weeks, we will be creating an interactive CV that showcases our skills and abilities.

It has to show our ability to collect images, videos and sounds. As well as our ability to plan and manage our time.

For myself, I wish to study towards and create a CV for either online teaching, or for cyber security. I have some ideas of things that I can include for this, I need to increase my skills for them all.

For the website side of things, my current plan is to go through Odin Project as quickly as possible so that I can create a website with interactive elements coded by myself.

The content, I was thinking some videos showing my ability to teach people to get others interested in my teaching skills (Already studied areas), as well as perhaps making my own capture the flags if I grow that ability, however that will come down later on the line.

For now, I need to make images for the layout, learn how to layout my website, and continue to develop those skills.
