# Morning Session

Thursday morning session was first spent talking to others to catch up on what I missed on Friday due to being unwell. After that I decided to use the free time to build on my web development skills by working more on the Odin Project.

To remember that we were moved rooms today due to the room that we were orginally in not being fully finished by the IT deparment yet, thus all the networks were insecure.
