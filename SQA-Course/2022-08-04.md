# Morning Session
A lesson on meta and soft skills, looking at the difference between hard and soft skills.

We have covered what they are and some of the ways of developing them.

Talking about why soft skills are more desirable than hard skills for employers because it's easier to teach hard skills rather than soft skills.

Thought about the job that we want to do in the future and what soft skills we currently have for the job and what other soft skills would be required for the job. After we thought through the list we discussed our lists with the lecturers and talked about which is our strongest and weakest of the soft skills needed and how to develop the weak skills.
